                  I am a passionate and dedicated developer with a solid foundation in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey into web development has equipped me with a strong grasp of ReactJS, allowing me to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I have experience with Redux Toolkit for state management and Bootstrap for styling, which enhances the user experience of my projects.
                  Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning backend development, focusing on Node.js. This will enable me to build full-fledged applications and deepen my understanding of server-side technologies. I am eager to integrate my frontend knowledge with backend capabilities to create robust and efficient web applications.
